            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Will Hoover, and I'm a first year software engineering major 
                at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I'm from metro Detroit Michigan,
                (West Bloomfield, to be precise) where I graduated from the Roeper School.
                When I'm not programming, doing fun stuff with math, or learning cool stuff,
                I like to run, play other recreational sports, play guitar, read, and occasionally
                write a short story. 
            </p>
